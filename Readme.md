## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to process retinal images and accurately segment the blood vessels, which is a critical step in diagnosing various eye-related diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertension. The project utilizes deep learning techniques, including the U-Net architecture, to achieve precise segmentation.

5. **flagged/**  
   - May contain flagged data, such as problematic or mislabeled data samples.

6. **new_data/**  
   - Contains new datasets or processed data prepared for training or testing.

7. **results/**  
   - Stores output data, model predictions, or evaluation results.

8. **results1/**  
   - Similar to `results/`, possibly used for a specific subset of experiments or iterations.

## Key Files

1. **Data.py**  
   - Handles data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation, specifically for retinal images.

2. **Dataprep.py**  
   - Prepares the dataset by cleaning, normalizing, resizing, and splitting into train/test sets.

3. **interface.py**  
   - Provides a user interface for uploading retinal images and displaying segmentation results.

4. **loss.py**  
   - Defines custom loss functions (e.g., Dice Loss, Binary Cross-Entropy) tailored for segmentation tasks.

5. **model.py**  
   - Contains the implementation of the machine learning or deep learning models.

6. **test.py**  
   - Used for evaluating the model on unseen test data and generating performance metrics.

7. **Unet.py**  
   - Implements the U-Net architecture, a popular model for biomedical image segmentation.

8. **uploaded_image.png**  
   - A sample retinal image used for testing or demonstration purposes.

9. **utils.py**  
   - Contains utility functions such as data visualization, metrics calculation, and file handling.

## Suggested Usage
1. **Setup Environment**  
   - Install the required dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy). Use a requirements.txt file if available.

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Use `Dataprep.py` to preprocess the retinal images and split the dataset.

3. **Training**  
   - Run scripts in the `training/` folder to train the U-Net model on the prepared data.

4. **Testing**  
   - Use `test.py` with data from the `test/` folder to evaluate the model's performance on unseen retinal images.

5. **Results**  
   - Check the `results/` folder for segmented images and performance metrics like accuracy, Dice coefficient, and IoU.

## Notes
- Ensure proper file paths are configured in scripts for datasets and models.  
- Pay attention to `Unet.py` for modifying the architecture or hyperparameters.
- Include proper documentation for reproducibility, especially in scripts like `interface.py` and `model.py`.
